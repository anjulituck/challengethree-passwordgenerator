# CHALLENGE THREE - Password Generator

Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It has a clean and polished user interface and is responsive, which ensures that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

# Status 
 I was able to get the prompts working but I couldn't get the password to generate itself. Work in progress.
